Prerequisites:
Eclipse Java Oxygen
Java(JDK) 8

Create a java project and create  java file in it.Copy the codes in a file named as BinaryHeap.java.
Program for Binary Search Tree.
Inputs and procedure to run the program:
In this program, when we add a positive element then that element will get added to the Binary search tree.
When we add a negative element then that element gets deleted from the binary search tree.
If we give zero as an output then it displays the Binary search tree using inorder traversal algorithm. In addition to that we also get minimum and maximum elements gets displayed on the console.
